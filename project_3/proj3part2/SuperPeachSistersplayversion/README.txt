To run SuperPeachSisters:

1. Locate the folder SuperPeachSisters, which should have in it files named
SuperPeachSisters and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/SuperPeachSisters or /Users/yourname/Downloads/SuperPeachSisters.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the
SuperPeachSisters folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the SuperPeachSisters executable.

4. Type
        ./SuperPeachSisters
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder SuperPeachSisters, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the SuperPeachSisters executable
file.
